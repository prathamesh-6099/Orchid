# ORCHIDE AI

## Master Architecture Specification (MAS)

Version: 1.0

Status: Draft

Project Type: Agentic Multimodal Research Intelligence Platform

Architecture Type: Dual-LLM Agent Orchestration

Primary Stack:

* React
* Bun
* Vite
* TypeScript
* FastAPI
* Redis
* PostgreSQL
* Gemini Pro
* Sarvam AI

# 1. Vision

ORCHIDE is a multilingual, multimodal, agentic research platform designed to provide high-quality market intelligence, financial research, trend analysis, and conversational discovery.

The platform combines:

* Structured Data APIs
* Agentic Planning
* Financial Intelligence
* Multilingual Communication
* Voice Interactions
* Source-backed Research

The system must prioritize reasoning quality, API efficiency, explainability, and production reliability.

The long-term objective is to create a research platform comparable to modern AI-native search systems while maintaining full control over orchestration and tool execution.

---

# 2. Core Principles

## Planner and Executor Separation

The planning model and conversational model must remain independent.

Gemini Pro:

* Intent understanding
* Query decomposition
* Tool selection
* Agent routing
* Reasoning strategy

Sarvam AI:

* Multilingual conversations
* Response generation
* Voice interactions
* User-facing communication

No direct user interaction should occur through Gemini.

Gemini thinks.

Sarvam communicates.

---

## Tool-First Research

Research must originate from structured data providers before LLM reasoning.

Priority:

1. APIs
2. Internal Context
3. Cached Results
4. LLM Reasoning

LLMs should never fabricate market data.

---

## API Efficiency

Every model invocation incurs cost.

The architecture must minimize:

* Duplicate requests
* Redundant planning
* Context inflation
* Repeated voice synthesis

Caching and orchestration are mandatory.

---

## Explainable Research

All research outputs should contain:

* Sources
* Agent reasoning traces
* Tool usage logs
* Research timestamps

---

# 3. Product Scope

Initial Capabilities:

* Conversational Research
* Financial Intelligence
* Market Analysis
* News Intelligence
* Trend Detection
* Multilingual Responses
* Voice Agent

Future Capabilities:

* Portfolio Intelligence
* Enterprise Workspaces
* Research Reports
* Team Collaboration
* Autonomous Monitoring Agents

---

# 4. System Architecture

High-Level Flow:

User
↓
Frontend
↓
Agent Gateway
↓
Orchestrator
↓
Planner (Gemini)
↓
Research Agents
↓
Reasoning Layer
↓
Response Generation (Sarvam)
↓
Frontend

The orchestrator acts as the central intelligence layer.

No frontend component should directly call LLM providers.

---

# 5. Dual LLM Architecture

## Gemini Pro Responsibilities

Purpose:
Planning and reasoning.

Capabilities:

* Intent Classification
* Task Planning
* Research Strategy
* Agent Routing
* Tool Selection
* Query Compression

Gemini outputs structured execution plans.

Example:

{
"intent":"market_analysis",
"steps":[
"fetch_news",
"fetch_market_data",
"run_sentiment_analysis",
"generate_summary"
]
}

Gemini should never generate the final user response.

---

## Sarvam AI Responsibilities

Purpose:
Conversation and multilingual communication.

Capabilities:

* English
* Hindi
* Marathi
* Tamil
* Telugu
* Bengali
* Gujarati
* Additional supported languages

Responsibilities:

* Final response generation
* Voice responses
* Summaries
* Follow-up conversations

Sarvam receives already-processed context.

Sarvam must not independently perform research.

---

# 6. Agent Orchestration Layer

The orchestration layer controls all execution.

Responsibilities:

* Intent routing
* Agent selection
* State management
* Context fusion
* Error handling
* Cost optimization

Folder:

src/agents/orchestration

Primary file:

agentOrchestrator.ts
